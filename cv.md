About me
----------------------------------------

I speak:

* English (C1)
* Spanish (B2)
* Russian (Native Speaker)

* I am a highly motivated person. Once I already switched from teaching to QA and now I've realized I want to do something more cretive than testing, so I'm trying to switch to development.
